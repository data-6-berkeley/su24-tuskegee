# Research and Discovery Group Project
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

## Overview
This summer seminar provide scholars an opportunity to explore independent projects early in their data scientist career that center around social science contexts.

Unlike a traditional open-ended research project, students will understand, explore, and reproduce existing contexts and findings of particular datasets; **through reproducibility**, students will build research skills and bridge interdisciplinary fields of study.

### Components
There are several components to this seminar:
1. **Lecture**{: .label .label-green} **Lecture series** on how to read semi-technical data science articles, consider ethical and social implications when studying a dataset, and do exploratory data analysis.

1. **Group**{: .label .label-blue} **Group work series** where work on projects together.

1. **Project**{: .label .label-yellow} **Project series**-based exploration of parts 1 and 2 in teams of 3-4 Tuskegee students and 1 UC Berkeley student.
Each group will focus on one social context.

### Learning Goals and Workload

After this seminar, scholars will have exposure to the following:

* How to read data science articles
* How to consider ethical and social implications when studying a dataset
* How to do Exploratory Data Analysis

We expect there to be little commitment outside of the scheduled 4 hours.

## [Milestone 1] Reading Data Science and Social Science Literature

**Due**:			Wednesday, June 26, as a presentation

**Project links**:

* Project one-pager: [One-Pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Mf3D80JXK6Nm97RjowK-8eHtgT1S5iSRVFuUIG6Pao/edit?usp=sharing){: target="_blank"}
* Group/Topic assignments: [Group sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R-gkvniZq-OB97MUK5xifbyIFtKmTp4HR34JF5P9T0c/edit?usp=drive_link)
* Project adapted from Stanford CS197 Assignment 1 [link](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs197/assignments/a1.html)
* Guided Reading Form [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1MhzrGzK-Il0kXfTjgb_-cgQbbsaKyQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113745915748997113650&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**Read a paper and outline its argument and structure.**

Research gets transmitted in many forms — demos, code, talks, and more — but its formal report most often occurs through a written paper. The paper explains the problem, the approach, and an evaluation. When ready, the academic submits the paper for review by other academics; once it passes this peer review process, the paper appears at a venue such as conference or journal. Since most research is disseminated in the form of papers, it's critical to be able to read research papers and make sense of them.


Each group has one starter research paper. Find yourself a quiet place and work your way through it. Don't worry if you can't understand every detail; focus on understanding the paper's big ideas and how they are argued. It can take time to read a paper — don't feel discouraged if it takes you a long time.


### Deliverable: Google Slides and Presentation
{:.no_toc}

Your Google Slide deck should outline the paper and provide additional research context. While these slides will not be presented anywhere, the Faculty Director will review all slides as part of the **Project Checkoff** and ask you questions.

Outline of paper (one slide per bullet)
* Overview: What paper did you read? Who are its authors, and what institution(s) are they affiliated with?
* Problem: What problem is it solving? Why does this problem matter?
* Assumption in prior work: What was the assumption that prior research made when solving this problem? Why was that assumption inadequate?
* Insight: What is the novel idea that this paper introduces, breaking from that prior assumption? Alternatively, how does this paper synthesize prior research?
* Proof: How did the paper evaluate or prove that its insight is correct, and better than holding onto the old assumption?
  * Visualization: What visualizations did the paper use to illustrate its proof? Share a figure that is meaningful to the thesis of the paper.
* Impact: What are the implications of this paper? How will it chnage how we think about the problem?

Additional research context (one slide per bullet):
* Summaries of recent current event articles relevant to this work
* Bio of a prominent researcher in the field at the intersection of society and data science

Additional readings (one slide):
* Suggest and summarize **three (3) additional readings** that provide additional context to your research question. At least one should be a research papers; the other two can be news articles or blog posts.

### Submission
Share the Google Slides with Faculty Director Lisa Yan by Wednesday Week 2.

## [Milestone 2] Exploratory Data Analysis

Conduct initial EDA, settle on a few datasets, and propose a more precise research question and an associated visualization.

**IN PROGRESS**

<!--
**Due**:			Monday July 17, end of seminar (tentatively)

**Expected Work Time**:
  * Monday 7/10: Look through data and get through half of questions.
  * Thursday 7/13: Explore rest of questions, begin looking at own questions (at least two). Start compiling Google Slides with findings by Friday.
  * Monday 7/17: Get slides checked off.

**Questions**: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZQ7B7sSaoOc8ss2YZF0uxOQ5AGzmXmBuA8SXC5nPJw/edit?usp=drive_link){: target="_blank"}

## [Milestone 3] Exploratory Data Analysis, Python

Continue EDA, use Python to create visualizations, and make progress towards your research question.

**IN PROGRESS**

<!--
**Due**:			Thursday July 27, middle of seminar (tentatively)

**Expected Work Time**:
  * Monday 7/17: Finish Colab setup; get slides checked off. Reproduce 2 figures from Google Sheets.
  * Thursday 7/20: Continue work.
  * Monday 7/24: Reproduce all of figures from Google Sheets, and start exploring 2 new figures or tables in Python.
  * Thursday 7/27: Finish up and get checked off.

**Note**: The `datascience` library has different plotting styles from Google Sheets. When "reproducing"  figure/plot, we expect that you will take considerable time getting the right tables and columns for plotting, then choosing the right arguments for `datascience` library functions. Here are the function reference sheets for [Data 8](http://data8.org/su22/python-reference.html){: target="_blank"} and [Data 6](https://data6.org/su22/reference/){:target="_blank"}.

It is less important to reproduce the formatting of the plot-- in fact doing so requires advanced plotting knowledge beyond the scope of Data 6/Data 8.

**Expected Work Time**:
  * Tuesday 8/2: Discussion building
  * 
  * Tuesday 7/19: Guest speaker; finish Colab setup; get slides checked off
  * Friday 7/22: Reproduce 2 figures from Google Sheets. UC Berkeley UGSIs switch to teaching role so that Tuskegee Scholars do bulk of programming
  * Tuesday 7/26: Guest speaker; start exploring new figure
  * Friday 7/29: Get slides and code checked off (Deb and Lisa to sit down and review code with each Tuskegee Scholar)

Questions:
* Pick 3-4 variables in the dataset and describe its conceptualization (from concept to variable definition) and operationalization (measurement and data collection).
* How were the data collectors/scientists connected to the population of interest? How may the historical context have impacted the data collection, reports, and policy decisions?

### Lesson plan details
{:.no_toc}

Describe particular norms an instructor should establish during this discussion, and what role the discussion facilitator should play. Are there any key terms a student should remember? How can an instructor guide the conversation away from criticism and towards constructive design?

## [Presentation] Final Presentation

Construct a 60-second elevator pitch that summarizes your research project.

Build and edit your slides from Project 1 to include EDA findings and social context discussion questions. The final presentation should be a standalone slide deck that can be shared with others.

**IN PROGRESS**

<!--
Build and edit your slides from Project 1 to include EDA findings and social context discussion questions. The final presentation should be a standalone slide deck that can be shared with future discussion instructors.

**Expected Work Time**:
  * Friday 7/29: Get slides and code checked off (Deb and Lisa to sit down and review code with each Tuskegee Scholar)
  * Thursday 8/3: Finish EDA/question exploration
  * Monday 8/7: Work on final presentation
  * **Wednesday 8/9**: Final Presentations. **3-4:30pm**


**Timing and slide limit**:
* Max time per presentation: **12 minutes**. Please be sure to distribute speaking parts *equally* among project memberes.
* Max slide count: Your presentations should be no longer than 15 slides, plus extra reference slides as needed.
* Audience Q&A: After your presentation, audience members (in-person or over Zoom) will ask questions.

**Final Presentation Components**:
* **Introduction**
    * Include as the first content slide your **elevator pitch**. This is a **two-sentence description** about your project and what you did.
      * Everyone is expected to remember their elevator pitch by latest Monday 8/7.
      * One person should deliver the elevator pitch out loud during the Wednesday presentations, but everyone is expected to remember and be able to recite the group elevator pitch by end of class on Monday 8/7.
    * Pleae include whatever else in your introduction that would provide a powerful motivation of your research problem.
* **Discussion activity**: A summary of your Project 1.
    * Required readings for students.
      * Pick at most 3 readings that students should read prior to discussion that will illuminate a particular dataset in the context of society. This may be a subset of the ones we provided, or you can pick your own from reputable sources.<br/>The readings should describe the topic itself, the current public opinion, any historical context, and a recent research study using the dataset.<br/>Readings should take about 1 hour, maximum.
      * It would be useful to give a one-sentence verbal explanation about the purpose of each of the readings in building student knowledge (e.g., original research study, explains dataset, is an opinion article, etc.).
    * Outline of a discusison question (Projects 1 and below social context questions)
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: A summary of your Project 2.
    * Python figures only that answer the questions originally posed to you.
* **Independent research question** and paired visualization.
    * Clearly state what you wanted to explore, and what takeaways you drew from either your visualization or the process of creating this visualization.
* **Conclusion, thoughts, and reflections**: At most 1-2 slides.
    * How was your experience exploring this dataset and context this summer?
    * What did you like, and what did you learn?
* Reference slides (not covered, but included in the presentation)
    * Required readings for students and instructors
    * Anything you read that you think an instructor or researcher would find useful, but would possibly be too in-depth for a student
