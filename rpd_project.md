# Research, Pedagogy, and Discovery Group Project
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

## Overview
This summer seminar provide scholars an opportunity to explore independent projects early in their data scientist career. Scholars will build pedagogically and socially motivated curricula for a new introductory computing course centered around data and science.

Unlike a traditional open-ended research project, students will understand, explore, and reproduce existing contexts and findings of particular datasets; **through reproducibility**, students will build research skills and bridge interdisciplinary fields of study.

### Components
There are several components to this seminar:
1. **Scholars**{: .label .label-green} **Lecture series** on how to read semi-technical data science articles, consider ethical and social implications when studying a dataset, and do exploratory data analysis.

1. **Group**{: .label .label-blue} **Lab/group work series** where students build small pieces of curricula, including how to write a discussion question and write a lab question.

1. **Project**{: .label .label-yellow} **Project series**-based exploration of parts 1 and 2 in teams of 3-4 Tuskegee students.
Each group will focus on one social context.

### Learning Goals and Workload

After this seminar, scholars will have exposure to the following:

* How to read data science articles
* How to consider ethical and social implications when studying a dataset
* How to do Exploratory Data Analysis
* How to write a discussion question
* How to write a lab question

We expect there to be little commitment outside of the scheduled 6 hours.

### Deliverable: Google Slides and Presentation
{:.no_toc}

Your Google Slide deck should have at least the following (max 15 slides):

* Slide: History of the topic
* Slide: Current public opinion
* Slide: Research example
* Slide: Bio of a prominent researcher in the field at the intersection of society and data science
* Slide: Lesson plan for discussion activity

**Presentation**: You will present these slides to the other groups in Week 3. The presentation should be **10 minutes**, and every group member should present. <del><b>These slides will not be presented anywhere!</b> The slides format is just to organize your thoughts. Feel free to add slides as necessary.</del>

### Lesson Plan for Discussion Activity

Outline a 15-minute introductory discussion that encourages students to discuss what they learned from the above readings. In particular, write a lesson plan for an instructor that includes the main takeaway point for students from this exercise. Discussion will be 50 minutes total, so this is the opening 1/4th of class. There should be several parts of this lesson:

* Reading list for students
* Lesson plan (see below):
    * How will you introduce the discussion section?
    * How will you structure the discussion of the question(s)? In groups, pairs, as a class? Will you have time to review as a class?
    * Share the main takeaway you will repeat for the students at the end of activity.

To answer the above, you should present a slide addressing the following table:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Student Required Readings** | Pick at most 3 readings that students should read prior to discussion that will illuminate a particular dataset in the context of society. This may be a subset of the ones we provided, or you can pick your own from reputable sources.<br/>The readings should describe the topic itself, the current public opinion, any historical context, and a recent research study using the dataset.<br/>Readings should take about 1 hour, maximum. |
| **Introduction**<br/>(5 minutes) | How will you introduce the discussion section? |
| **Recall Activity**<br/>(10 minutes) | Pose a question you to get students positioned and warmed up to discuss. It often involves students “recalling” what was in their required readings. | 
| **Activity structure** | How will you structure the discussion of this question(s)? In small groups, pairs, as a class? Will you have time to review as a class before or after the activity? |
| **Learning Goal/Outcome** | Write a sentence for the instructor-facing lesson plan, e.g., “By the end of this activity, students will be able to…” (see [Action Verbs](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/resources/design/course-level-learning-goalsoutcomes){:target="_blank"}) |
| **Main Takeaway**<br/>(2 minutes) | Share the main student-facing takeaway that you will repeat for the students at the end of activity. | 

### Submission

Send the Google Slides through Slack. Also deliver a presentation to the seminar as above.

## [Project 2] Exploratory Data Analysis

**Due**:			Monday July 17, end of seminar (tentatively)

**Expected Work Time**:
  * Monday 7/10: Look through data and get through half of questions.
  * Thursday 7/13: Explore rest of questions, begin looking at own questions (at least two). Start compiling Google Slides with findings by Friday.
  * Monday 7/17: Get slides checked off.

**Questions**: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZQ7B7sSaoOc8ss2YZF0uxOQ5AGzmXmBuA8SXC5nPJw/edit?usp=drive_link){: target="_blank"}

## [Project 3] Exploratory Data Analysis, Python

**Due**:			Thursday July 27, middle of seminar (tentatively)

**Expected Work Time**:
  * Monday 7/17: Finish Colab setup; get slides checked off. Reproduce 2 figures from Google Sheets.
  * Thursday 7/20: Continue work.
  * Monday 7/24: Reproduce all of figures from Google Sheets, and start exploring 2 new figures or tables in Python.
  * Thursday 7/27: Finish up and get checked off.

**Note**: The `datascience` library has different plotting styles from Google Sheets. When "reproducing"  figure/plot, we expect that you will take considerable time getting the right tables and columns for plotting, then choosing the right arguments for `datascience` library functions. Here are the function reference sheets for [Data 8](http://data8.org/su22/python-reference.html){: target="_blank"} and [Data 6](https://data6.org/su22/reference/){:target="_blank"}.

It is less important to reproduce the formatting of the plot-- in fact doing so requires advanced plotting knowledge beyond the scope of Data 6/Data 8.

## [Project 4] Social and Ethical Implications of Data

### Discussion Question 2: Social and Behavioral Science Methodology
{:.no_toc}

**Due**:			(n/a, bundled into final presentation)

**Expected Work Time**:
  * Tuesday 8/2: Discussion building
  * 
  * Tuesday 7/19: Guest speaker; finish Colab setup; get slides checked off
  * Friday 7/22: Reproduce 2 figures from Google Sheets. UC Berkeley UGSIs switch to teaching role so that Tuskegee Scholars do bulk of programming
  * Tuesday 7/26: Guest speaker; start exploring new figure
  * Friday 7/29: Get slides and code checked off (Deb and Lisa to sit down and review code with each Tuskegee Scholar)

Questions:
* Pick 3-4 variables in the dataset and describe its conceptualization (from concept to variable definition) and operationalization (measurement and data collection).
* How were the data collectors/scientists connected to the population of interest? How may the historical context have impacted the data collection, reports, and policy decisions?

### Lesson plan details
{:.no_toc}

Describe particular norms an instructor should establish during this discussion, and what role the discussion facilitator should play. Are there any key terms a student should remember? How can an instructor guide the conversation away from criticism and towards constructive design?
