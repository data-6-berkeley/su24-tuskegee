bio: Hey! I'm a rising senior  from Cape Cod, MA studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. Outside of teaching, you'll likely find me curating Spotify playlists, playing Wii Tennis, or shooting film on my Canon AE-1. I'm incredibly excited to be teaching Data 6 this summer. Reach out with any questions -- any at all!
